# History Culminating Assessment
This website is a visually engaging showcase of the Top 10 most significant events in Canadian and world history, presenting key moments with clear explanations, impactful storytelling, and stunning graphics that helps users understand how these events shaped the modern world. I chose to do Part 2 of my culminating assessment as a website, as I felt I could easily display and justify the significance of each event through this project.
